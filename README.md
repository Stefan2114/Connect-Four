# Connect-Four


## A tiny game written in Python that can put up a real challange, made to bring back the good old memories!

This project was build as a homework for my last assignment in the first semester of my faculty. It's main objective was to offer a competitive AI to play against the human player

## Options:
* Change who to start first
* Change the difficulty of the computer player
* Change from console UI to graphic UI

## Features:
* Drop a piece on one of the available columns by using the left-click button
* Objective: connect 4 pieces on a rows/column/diagonal
* The AI will try to defeate you

## Implementation:
* Object Oriented Programming
* Layered architecture
* Errors handling
* AI is implemented using the minmax algorithm
* The score for each move is calculating taking in consideration all the pices from the board
* Each move is evaluated based on its potential impact on the game. Positive points are assigned to favorable moves, while negative points are assigned to unfavorable ones

# You can run it on repl.it
